CHE261 Course Project

Established a mock chemical plant to manufacture Diphenic Acid in India, considering detailed cost and feasibility analysis. Researched the production process
of Diphenic Acid and identified key reactants and necessary operating conditions. Conducted material balances on the input and output products and showed the 
process through the block diagrams. Determined the cost of the reactor using the product's volume requirement.
